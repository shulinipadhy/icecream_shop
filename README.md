Application:
This application is a very simple icecream ordering service! Every tab has options, where the user can choose the toppings/flavours they prefer on their icecream. The user interface is very friendly and clear. The customer can choose between a variety of flavours, the number of scoops (depending on the size), the type of cone they want or bowl, and a number of toppings. The total price is dependent on the size the customer chooses. Once they choose the size, the total price is given at the very end while ordering the icecream. 



Architecture:
This application was made using Android Studio in Java. The appliation uses the TabLayout class, and each tab is designated to choosing certain elements to the icecream. Each element (such as choice of toppings, flavours, size, etc.) has its own fragment class and XML sheet, where it includes each tab's UI design. The MainActivity class includes a switch and case method with the radio buttons of the sizes, to add up the total price of the icecream order. Each cone/bowl size has a certain price, and by choosing the certain radio button, that price gets added to the total textbox. The PNG file of the class diagram is included in the repository.
